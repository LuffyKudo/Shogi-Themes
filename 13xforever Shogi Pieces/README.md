# 13xforever Shogi Pieces
13xforever Shogi Pieces are pieces made by 13xforever available on [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:13xforever_SVG_Shogi_Pieces). These pieces are also available in the shogi software [BCMGames](https://www.chessvariants.com/programs.dir/bcmshogi.html), also known as BCMShogi, by Bernard C. März.

And now you can play shogi using 13xforever Shogi Pieces on 81Dojo and Lishogi!

As seen in the image above, I added the standard black-colored promoted pieces as well as the 1-kanji pieces.

- Available in 2-Kanji and 1-Kanji styles
- Also available with red promoted pieces
- Works with matches, puzzles, analysis and board editor
- Works with all variants except with Dobutsu Shogi on 81Dojo and Chu Shogi on Lishogi

## Features
- Option to select either 2-Kanji (_default_) or 1-Kanji style
- Ability to toggle red promoted pieces On and Off (_default_)
- Choose between four Kings style:
  - Gyoku-Ou (Sente has the Jewel while Gote has the King)[_default_]
  - Ou-Gyoku (Sente has the King while Gote has the Jewel)
  - Double Gyoku (both have the Jewels)
  - Double Ou (both have the Kings)

***\*Note:** 81Dojo already has the correct distinction for Gyoku and Ou (Jewel and King), which is Ou for the higher rated/ranked player, so the default “Gyoku-Ou” should be selected for the Kings Style. However, for loaded external kifus, it seems like sente always has the gyoku, so you have the freedom to select the Kings Style depending on the ranking and your preference.*
