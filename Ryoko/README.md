# Ryoko (菱湖) Style Shogi Pieces

Play shogi using Ryoko calligraphy style shogi pieces on Lishogi!

Ryoko style shogi pieces are based on the calligraphy of [Maki Ryōko (巻菱湖)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B7%BB%E8%8F%B1%E6%B9%96), one of the Three Great Calligraphers of the late Edo period. Along with Kinki and Minase styles, Ryoko is one of the three most popular and used shogi pieces styles.

I recreated the pieces in Inkscape SVG format and as seen in the image above, I added the 1-kanji as well as the red promoted pieces to the standard black-colored, 2-kanji set.

- Available in 2-Kanji and 1-Kanji styles
- Also available with red promoted pieces
- Works with matches, puzzles, analysis and board editor
- Works with all variants except with Chu Shogi 

## Features
- Option to select either 2-Kanji (_default_) or 1-Kanji style
- Ability to toggle red promoted pieces On and Off (_default_)
- Choose between four Kings style:
  - Gyoku-Ou (Sente has the Jewel while Gote has the King)[_default_]
  - Ou-Gyoku (Sente has the King while Gote has the Jewel)
  - Double Gyoku (both have the Jewels)
  - Double Ou (both have the Kings)
