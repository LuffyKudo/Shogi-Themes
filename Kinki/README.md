# Kinki (錦旗) Style Shogi Pieces

Play shogi using Kinki calligraphy style shogi pieces on 81Dojo and Lishogi!

Kinki style shogi pieces was created by [Toshima Ryuzan (豊島龍山)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B1%8A%E5%B3%B6%E9%BE%8D%E5%B1%B1), a shogi piece craftsman and is known as the Father of Modern Shogi Pieces. He based it on the writing style of [Emperor Go-Mizunoo
(後水尾天皇)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Mizunoo) which was handed down in the Ohashi family, one of the three head families of shogi during the Edo period. The name Kinki (錦旗) was taken from the first and last characters of **錦**の御**旗** (_Nishiki no Mihata_, Nishiki flag).

Kinki is the most popular and used shogi pieces style and along with Minase and Ryoko styles, is one of the main calligraphy styles used on shogi pieces.

I recreated the pieces in Inkscape SVG format and as seen in the image above, I added the 1-kanji as well as the red promoted pieces to the standard black-colored, 2-kanji set.

- Available in 2-Kanji and 1-Kanji styles
- Also available with red promoted pieces
- Works with matches, puzzles, analysis and board editor
- Works with all variants except with Dobutsu Shogi on 81Dojo and Chu Shogi on Lishogi

## Features
- Option to select either 2-Kanji (_default_) or 1-Kanji style
- Ability to toggle red promoted pieces On and Off (_default_)
- Choose between four Kings style:
  - Gyoku-Ou (Sente has the Jewel while Gote has the King)[_default_]
  - Ou-Gyoku (Sente has the King while Gote has the Jewel)
  - Double Gyoku (both have the Jewels)
  - Double Ou (both have the Kings)

***\*Note:** 81Dojo already has the correct distinction for Gyoku and Ou (Jewel and King), which is Ou for the higher rated/ranked player, so the default “Gyoku-Ou” should be selected for the Kings Style. However, for loaded external kifus, it seems like sente always has the gyoku, so you have the freedom to select the Kings Style depending on the ranking and your preference.*
